```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Code to output to different directory:
<!-- knit: (function(inputFile, encoding) {  -->
<!--       out_dir <- 'test'; -->
<!--       rmarkdown::render(inputFile, -->
<!--                         encoding=encoding,  -->
<!--                         output_file=file.path(dirname(inputFile), out_dir, 'analysis.html')) }) -->

## Project Summary

Programmatically design a speed dial to set the spindle RPM on a manual machine tool. Output an SVG for laser etching.

## David's Background

- Series of high school shop classes
- PostScript printer driver and firmware development
- Digital photography

## Fonts

- Legibility important for safe operation
- Space contraints need to be solved
- Layout contributes to efficient operation

## Not All Fonts Are Equal `r emo::ji("confounded")`

- Included vs Free vs Paid
- Glyph set
- Encoding
- Format (PostScript Type1, TrueType, Open Font)

## Quartz Fonts

```{r quartz-fonts, echo=TRUE}
quartzFonts()
```

## The Fun Part - Picking a Font

extrafont

## RStudio's Graphic Device

```
options("device")
$device
[1] "RStudioGD"
```

Has some interesting properties...

- [Figure size in RStudio is different than in rendered output](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/4521)
- [Plots with fixed fig.width are rendered differently in rstudio and knitr output](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/4913)

## Circlize's Plot Sequence

1. `par()`
1. `circos.par()`
1. `circos.initialize()`
1. `par(new)` <----- The Trick

## R Ecosystem

Packages used:

- circlize
- extrafonts
- R.Devices (verify)
- tibble
